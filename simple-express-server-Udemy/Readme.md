This is just a very simple express server that I built following Udemy's Tutorial. This server only serves few static pages with basic Bootstrap templates. Can receive GET and POST request collecting data from forms.

To checkout the project do ``git clone  git@github.com:rohan-paul/Simple_Express_Server.git``

And then from the root of the project run ``node app``
